# AdmissionSystem
This is a school admission records system in C++. To simplify the implementation of this project, I have maintained admission records only for classes 9 to 12. This allows the user to admit a new student, modify the records of an existing student (address or mobile number or both), delete a student record, search for a student record, and display all student records of a particular grade. There are 4 separate files, one for each grade, to maintain the student records of that particular grade. A student is admitted to a particular grade based on their age, which is calculated from the date of birth entered by the user. There is also a file which keeps track of the last admission number assigned to a student, so that when a new student joins, this number is incremented, assigned to the new student, and stored back in the file. This helps in ensuring that a unique admission number is assigned to every new student. This school admission records system extensively makes use of the concept of file handling in C++.
